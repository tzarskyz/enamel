enamel
======

A python library for converting to and from ENML, initially html and plain text.

Notes:
* Still in skeleton form. Feedback requested.
* Most likely will use bleach, beautifulsoup to massage the data
* If there is already a library out there that does this, let us know to save us the trouble

A collaboration between [Filepicker.io](http://www.filepicker.io) and [Zapier](http://zapier.com)
